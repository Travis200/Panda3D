Overall, I think this exercise has given me a new experience and helped me learn how to use Gitlab along with PyCharm. I have also learned how important it is to push the file after committing, because I didn’t do this yesterday and lost all my work! On a positive note, though, I believe it was better to make the mistake at this stage on a much smaller project, than at a later date in a much bigger project. I think this has been a useful introduction to programming for me however it has shown me that I have a long way to go, and a lot to learn. I have used python in the past however it was at a very basic level, of which I cannot remember much apart from very basic level programming skills such as If/Else statements, while loops, and so forth.  

Overall this was a very new experience for me, I feel like I will need to complete many more practical’s and lectures to improve my programming skills. Initially I had some technical issues and my code did not work straight away, however, I persevered until I had a working piece of code. In my opinion, I think it can be a good thing when the program (or anything else in life for that matter) doesn’t work correctly first time because I feel like one of the best ways to learn is when something does not initially work but you then you figure out the error as this means that, the next time you do something similar, you probably will not make the same error again.  I think PyCharm seems like a good IDE, because it appears to be easy to use, and lays my code out well, as well as providing useful colour coding which can make reading code easier to understand and comprehend.  

To further improve, I will add sounds to the project. I am currently unsure how to add sounds, however I think I will figure this out by looking on the panda3d website for clues and then download a (copyright free) sound of a panda and then attempt to implement this sound into the programme. I think this will be a good learning curve for me as it will give me the opportunity to try something new. I believe the hardest part of this exercise will be getting the the panda sound to play constantly; I am considering this could be done with a loop.  

In summary I think this exercise was a good introduction to python. My only criticism of the exercise is that  I feel like the task is more of an exercise that allows you to get used to the software involved, and where and how to write various pieces of code, as a pose to the actual understanding the fundamentals of how and why the code works. I think GitLab will be useful for my studies because it will enable me to work on the same project both on own personal computer and the computers in the Lab and seamlessly be able to switch between the two.
